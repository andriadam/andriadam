### Hi there, My name is Andri AdamðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer who has started working on several website development projects in 2021 as a freelancer, starting from UMKM projects to corporate projects. My most recent role was as a full-stack developer at a fintech firm. I am diligent, thrive on challenges, and possess a quick learning aptitude, relishing opportunities to explore novel domains. My knack for efficiently tackling technical issues is noteworthy.
